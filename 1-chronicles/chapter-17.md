## Chapter 17

David's purposes; God's gracious promises.

This chapter is the same as 2Sa 7. See what is there said upon it. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, “for thy word's sake,” is here said to be, “for thy servant's sake,” ver. #(19). Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.
