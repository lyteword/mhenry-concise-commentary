## Chapter 15

### Chapter Outline

- Reign of Azariah, or Uzziah, king of Judah. (1–7)
- The latter kings of Israel. (8–31)
- Jotham, king of Judah. (32–38)

### Verses 1–7

Uzziah did for the most part that which was right. It was happy for the kingdom that a good reign was a long one.

### Verses 8–31

This history shows Israel in confusion. Though Judah was not without troubles, yet that kingdom was happy, compared with the state of Israel. The imperfections of true believers are very different from the allowed wickedness of ungodly men. Such is human nature, such are our hearts, if left to themselves, deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. We have reason to be thankful for restraints, for being kept out of temptation, and should beg of God to renew a right spirit within us.

### Verses 32–38

Jotham showed great respect to the temple. If magistrates cannot do all they would, for the suppressing of vice and profaneness, let them do the more to support and advance piety and virtue.
