# Jonah

Jonah presents an historical account, likely written by the prophet himself. A messenger from Gath-hepher in Galilee (2 Kings 14:25), he served during Jeroboam II’s reign, and his prophetic message to Nineveh was central to the narrative. The book emphasizes God’s compassion and responsive love through forgiveness and highlights Jonah’s own struggles, ultimately foreshadowing Christ’s arrival.
