# Obadiah

Obadiah’s prophetic vision is about judgment against the nation of Edom. There is debate about Obadiah's identity with possibilities ranging from the steward of Ahab (1 Kings 18:3), to a contemporary of Hosea and Amos, to one who lived during the time of Jerusalem’s destruction.

## Chapter 1

The book details the hostility between Israel and Edom. God threatens Edom’s downfall; their riches would be seized, intelligence misguided and that vengeance for hostility towards Israel would be exacted, resulting in Israel’s restoration and victory through the establishment of a new kingdom. This triumph leading to deliverance and the Messiah’s reign.

### Verses 1-9, The Doom of Edom

The prophecy warns of Edom’s coming destruction, shown through a divine message urging mobilization for war. Edom’s trust in wealth, alliances, military might and human counsel results in believing that they have guaranteed security and that no one could bring them down, even God (Psalm 10:5). Their arrogance in believing to be invincible, and their reliance on earthly things, proved disastrous and foolish (Psalm 49:10), as they were brought to ruin (Jeremiah 49:7,15-17). This shows the need to depend on God’s protection rather than relying only on worldly things.

### Verses 10-16, The Guilt of Edom

The Edomites were condemned for their malicious taunting and exploitation of Judah’s suffering, as described in passages like Psalm 137:7 and Ezekiel 25:12. They participated in Jerusalem’s destruction and looting. As a consequence they face a similar fate for themselves showing that all nations, including the Edomites, will face trials mirroring Israel’s experience. God’s judgment falls on nations that reject Him, as seen in prophecies concerning Edom (Jeremiah 49:12) and at the end, removal of all opposition (Jeremiah 25:29). Unlike the brief suffering of God’s people (Psalm 60:3), the punishment of His enemies is eternal (Revelation 14:10), leading to their doom. Those who embrace wickedness will consume the full cup of God’s wrath (Psalm 75:8, Isaiah 51:22-23).


### Verses 17-21, Promises to Israel and Judah

After the judgment a great salvation is promised. Mount Zion, a sacred hill where God's king reigns (Psalm 2:6), symbolizes God’s deliverance for the Jewish people (John 4:22), particularly a saved remnant, mirroring past deliverances and foreshadowing Christ’s salvation. This extends to the Christian church, where the New Testament teachings arise and salvation is proclaimed (Isaiah 2:3). This is a future kingdom led by Jesus Christ, offering deliverance to faithful believers and judgment to those who reject faith. Both Jewish and Gentile nations contribute to a growing of God’s kingdom, leading to the establishment of Christ’s throne and the overcoming of evil (Revelation 21:24). Saviors, those who have been delivered, emerge on Mount Zion to guide believers and judge unbelieving Mount Esau. God’s authority guarantees the expansion of the kingdom.
