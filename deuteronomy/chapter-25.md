# Chapter 25

## Chapter Outline

- Extent of punishment. (1–3)
- The ox that treadeth the corn. (4)
- Marriage of a brother's wife. (5–12)
- Of unjust weights. (13–16)
- War against Amalek. (17–19)

## Verses 1–3

Every punishment should be with solemnity, that those who see it may be filled with dread, and be warned not to offend in like manner. And though the criminals must be shamed as well as put to pain, for their warning and disgrace, yet care should be taken that they do not appear totally vile. Happy those who are chastened of the Lord to humble them, that they should not be condemned with the world to destruction.

## Verse 4

This is a charge to husbandmen. It teaches us to make much of the animals that serve us. But we must learn, not only to be just, but kind to all who are employed for the good of our better part, our souls, 1Co 9:9.

## Verses 5–12

The custom here regulated seems to have been in the Jewish law in order to keep inheritances distinct; now it is unlawful.

## Verses 13–16

Dishonest gain always brings a curse on men's property, families, and souls. Happy those who judge themselves, repent of and forsake their sins, and put away evil things, that they may not be condemned of the Lord.

## Verses 17–19

Let every persecutor and injurer of God's people take warning from the case of the Amalekites. The longer it is before judgement comes, the more dreadful will it be at last. Amalek may remind us of the foes of our souls. May we be enabled to slay all our lusts, all the corruptions both within and without, all the powers of darkness and of the world, which oppose our way to the blessed Saviour.
