## Chapter 44

### Chapter Outline

- The Vision of the Temple. (1-31)

### Verses 1-31

This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. The prince evidently means Christ, and the words in 2, may remind us that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did; namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness, righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah's glory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the whole human race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood, and by the power of his grace.
