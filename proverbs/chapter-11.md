## Chapter 11


### Verse 1

However men may make light of giving short weight or measure, and however common such crimes may be, they are an abomination to the Lord.

### Verse 2

Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy the humble are, we see that with the lowly is wisdom.

### Verse 3

An honest man's principles are fixed, therefore his way is plain.

### Verse 4

Riches will stand men in no stead in the day of death.

### Verses 5, 6

The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its own punishment.

### Verse 7

When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies, his hopes vanish.

### Verse 8

The righteous are often wonderfully kept from going into dangerous situations, and the ungodly go in their stead.

### Verse 9

Hypocrites delude men into error and sin by artful objections against the truths of God's word.

### Verses 10, 11

Nations prosper when wicked men are cast down.

### Verse 12

A man of understanding does not judge of others by their success.

### Verse 13

A faithful man will not disclose what he is trusted with, unless the honour of God and the real good of society require it.

### Verse 14

We shall often find it to our advantage to advise with others.

### Verse 15

The welfare of our families, our own peace, and our ability to pay just debts, must not be brought into danger. But here especially let us consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in becoming Surety even for enemies.

### Verse 16

A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth.

### Verse 17

A cruel, froward, ill-natured man, is vexatious to those that are, and should be to him as his own flesh, and punishes himself.

### Verse 18

He that makes it his business to do good, shall have a reward, as sure to him as eternal truth can make it.

### Verse 19

True holiness is true happiness. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits, the more he hastens his own destruction.

### Verse 20

Nothing is more hateful to God, than hypocrisy and double dealing, which are here signified. God delights in such as aim and act with uprightness.

### Verse 21

Joining together in sin shall not protect the sinners.

### Verse 22

Beauty is abused by those who have not discretion or modesty with it. This is true of all bodily endowments.

### Verse 23

The wicked desire mischief to others, but it shall return upon themselves.

### Verse 24

A man may grow poor by not paying just debts, not relieving the poor, not allowing needful expenses. Let men be ever so saving of what they have, if God appoints, it comes to nothing.

### Verse 25

Both in temporal and spiritual things, God commonly deals with his people according to the measure by which they deal with their brethren.

### Verse 26

We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage.

### Verse 27

Seeking mischief is here set against seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt, even to themselves.

### Verse 28

The true believer is a branch of the living Vine. When those that take root in the world wither, those who are grafted into Christ shall be fruitful.

### Verse 29

He that brings trouble upon himself and his family, by carelessness, or by wickedness, shall be unable to keep and enjoy what he gets, as a man is unable to hold the wind, or to satisfy himself with it.

### Verse 30

The righteous are as trees of life; and their influence upon earth, like the fruits of that tree, support and nourish the spiritual life in many.

### Verse 31

Even the righteous, when they offend on earth, shall meet with sharp corrections; much more will the wicked meet the due reward of their sins. Let us then seek those blessings which our Surety purchased by his sufferings and death; let us seek to copy his example, and to keep his commandments.
