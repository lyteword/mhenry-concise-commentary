## Chapter 14


### Verse 1

A woman who has no fear of God, who is wilful and wasteful, and indulges her ease, will as certainly ruin her family, as if she plucked her house down.

### Verse 2

Here are grace and sin in their true colours. Those that despise God's precepts and promises, despise God and all his power and mercy.

### Verse 3

Pride grows from that root of bitterness which is in the heart. The root must be plucked up, or we cannot conquer this branch. The prudent words of wise men get them out of difficulties.

### Verse 4

There can be no advantage without something which, though of little moment, will affright the indolent.

### Verse 5

A conscientious witness will not dare to represent anything otherwise than according to his knowledge.

### Verse 6

A scorner treats Divine things with contempt. He that feels his ignorance and unworthiness will search the Scriptures in a humble spirit.

### Verse 7

We discover a wicked man if there is no savour of piety in his discourse.

### Verse 8

We are travellers, whose concern is, not to spy out wonders, but to get to their journey's end; to understand the rules we are to walk by, also the ends we are to walk toward. The bad man cheats himself, and goes on in his mistake.

### Verse 9

Foolish and profane men consider sin a mere trifle, to be made light of rather than mourned over. Fools mock at the sin-offering; but those that make light of sin, make light of Christ.

### Verse 10

We do not know what stings of conscience, or consuming passions, torment the prosperous sinner. Nor does the world know the peace of mind a serious Christian enjoys, even in poverty and sickness.

### Verse 11

Sin ruins many great families; whilst righteousness often raises and strengthens even mean families.

### Verse 12

The ways of carelessness, of worldliness, and of sensuality, seem right to those that walk in them; but self-deceivers prove self-destroyers. See the vanity of carnal mirth.

### Verse 14

Of all sinners backsliders will have the most terror when they reflect on their own ways.

### Verse 15

Eager readiness to believe what others say, has ever proved mischievous. The whole world was thus ruined at first. The man who is spiritually wise, depends on the Saviour alone for acceptance. He is watchful against the enemies of his salvation, by taking heed to God's word.

### Verse 16

Holy fear guards against every thing unholy.

### Verse 17

An angry man is to be pitied as well as blamed; but the revengeful is more hateful.

### Verse 18

Sin is the shame of sinners; but wisdom is the honour of the wise.

### Verse 19

Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people.

### Verse 20

Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us.

### Verse 21

To despise a man for his employment or appearance is a sin.

### Verse 22

How wisely those consult their own interest, who not only do good, but devise it!

### Verse 23

Labour of the head, or of the hand, will turn to some good account. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to nothing.

### Verse 24

The riches of men of wisdom and piety enlarge their usefulness.

### Verse 25

An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light.

### Verses 26, 27

Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death.

### Verse 28

Let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, do what they can, that many may be added to his church.

### Verse 29

A mild, patient man is one that learns of Christ, who is Wisdom itself. Unbridled passion is folly made known.

### Verse 30

An upright, contented, and benevolent mind, tends to health.

### Verse 31

To oppress the poor is to reproach our Creator.

### Verse 32

The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them.

### Verse 33

Wisdom possesses the heart, and thus regulates the affections and tempers.

### Verse 34

Piety and holiness always promote industry, sobriety, and honesty.

### Verse 35

The great King who reigns over heaven and earth, will reward faithful servants who honour his gospel by the proper discharge of the duties of their stations: he despises not the services of the lowest.
