### Verse 3

Roll the burden of thy care upon God, and leave it with him, by faith and dependence on him.

### Verse 4

God makes use of the wicked to execute righteous vengeance on each other; and he will be glorified by their destruction at last.

### Verse 5

Though sinners strengthen themselves and one another, they shall not escape God's judgments.

### Verse 6

By the mercy and truth of God in Christ Jesus, the sins of believers are taken away, and the power of sin is broken.

### Verse 7

He that has all hearts in his hand, can make a man's enemies to be at peace with him.

### Verse 8

A small estate, honestly come by, will turn to better account than a great estate ill-gotten.

### Verse 9

If men make God's glory their end, and his will their rule, he will direct their steps by his Spirit and grace. 10. Let kings and judges of the earth be just, and rule in the fear of God.

### Verse 11

To observe justice in dealings between man and man is God's appointment.

### Verse 12

The ruler that uses his power aright, will find that to be his best security.

### Verse 13

### Verses 14, 15

Those are fools, who, to obtain the favour of an earthly prince, throw themselves out of God's favour.

### Verse 16

There is joy and satisfaction of spirit, only in getting wisdom.

### Verse 17

A sincerely religious man keeps at a distance from every appearance of evil. Happy is the man that walks in Christ, and is led by the Spirit of Christ.

### Verse 18

When men defy God's judgments, and think themselves far from them, it is a sign they are at the door. Let us not fear the pride of others, but fear pride in ourselves.

### Verse 19

Humility, though it exposes to contempt in the world, is much better than high-spiritedness, which makes God an enemy. He that understands God's word shall find good.

### Verse 21

The man whose wisdom dwells in his heart, will be found more truly prudent than many who possess shining talents.

### Verse 22

As waters to a thirsty land, so is a wise man to his friends and neighbours.

### Verse 23

The wise man's self-knowledge, always suggests something proper to be spoken to others.

The word of God cures the diseases that weaken our souls.

### Verse 25

This is caution to all, to take heed of deceiving themselves as to their souls.

### Verse 26

We must labour for the meat which endureth to everlasting life, or we must perish.

### Verses 27, 28

Ungodly men bestow more pains to do mischief than would be needful to do good. The whisperer separates friends: what a hateful, but how common a character!

### Verses 29, 30

Some do all the mischief they can by force and violence, and are blind to the result.

### Verse 31

Old people especially should be found in the way of religion and godliness.

### Verse 32

To overcome our own passions, requires more steady management, than obtaining victory over an enemy.

### Verse 33

All the disposal of Providence concerning our affairs, we must look upon to be the determining what we referred to God; and we must be reconciled to them accordingly. Blessed are those that give themselves up to the will of God; for he knows what is good for them.
