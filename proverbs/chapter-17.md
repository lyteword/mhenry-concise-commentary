## Chapter 17


### Verse 1

These words recommend family love and peace, as needful for the comfort of human life.

### Verse 2

The wise servant is more deserving, and more likely to appear one of the family, than a profligate son.

### Verse 3

God tries the heart by affliction. He thus has often shown the sin remaining in the heart of the believer.

### Verse 4

Flatterers, especially false teachers, are welcome to those that live in sin.

### Verse 5

Those that laugh at poverty, treat God's providence and precepts with contempt.

### Verse 6

It is an honour to children to have wise and godly parents continued to them, even after they are grown up and settled in the world.

### Verse 7

A fool, in Solomon's Proverbs, signifies a wicked man, whom excellent speech does not become, because his conversation contradicts it.

### Verse 8

Those who set their hearts upon money, will do any thing for it. What influence should the gifts of God have on our hearts!

### Verse 9

The way to preserve peace is to make the best of every thing; not to notice what has been said or done against ourselves.

### Verse 10

A gentle reproof will enter, not only into the head, but into the heart of a wise man.

### Verse 11

Satan, and the messengers of Satan, shall be let loose upon an evil man.

### Verse 12

Let us watch over our own passions, and avoid the company of furious men.

### Verse 13

To render evil for good is devilish. He that does so, brings a curse upon his family.

### Verse 14

What danger there is in the beginning of strife! Resist its earliest display; and leave it off, if it were possible, before you begin.

### Verse 15

It is an offence to God to acquit the guilty, or to condemn those who are not guilty.

### Verse 16

Man's neglect of God's favour and his own interest is very absurd.

### Verse 17

No change of outward circumstances should abate our affection for our friends or relatives. But no friend, except Christ, deserves unlimited confidence. In Him this text did receive, and still receives its most glorious fulfilment.

### Verse 18

Let not any wrong their families. Yet Christ's becoming Surety for men, was a glorious display of Divine wisdom; for he was able to discharge the bond.

### Verse 19

If we would keep a clear conscience and a quiet mind, we must shun all excitements to anger. And a man who affects a style of living above his means, goes the way to ruin.

### Verse 20

There is nothing got by ill designs. And many have paid dear for an unbridled tongue.

### Verse 21

This speaks very plainly what many wise and good men feel very strongly, how grievous it is to have a foolish, wicked child.

### Verse 22

It is great mercy that God gives us leave to be cheerful, and cause to be cheerful, if by his grace he gives us hearts to be cheerful.

### Verse 23

The wicked are ready to part with their money, though loved, that they may not suffer for their crimes.

### Verse 24

The prudent man keeps the word of God continually in view. But the foolish man cannot fix his thoughts, nor pursue any purpose with steadiness.

### Verse 25

Wicked children despise the authority of their father, and the tenderness of their mother.

### Verse 26

It is very wrong to find fault for doing what is duty.

### Verses 27, 28

A man may show himself to be a wise man, by the good temper of his mind, and by the good government of his tongue. He is careful when he does speak, to speak to the purpose. God knows his heart, and the folly that is bound there; therefore he cannot be deceived in his judgment as men may be.
