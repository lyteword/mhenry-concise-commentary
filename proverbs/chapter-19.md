## Chapter 19


### Verse 1

A poor man who fears God, is more honourable and happy, than a man without wisdom and grace, however rich or advanced in rank.

### Verse 2

What good can the soul do, if without knowledge? And he sins who will not take time to ponder the path of his feet.

### Verse 3

Men run into troubles by their own folly, and then fret at the appointments of God.

### Verse 4

Here we may see how strong is men's love of money.

### Verse 5

Those that tell lies in discourse, are in a fair way to be guilty of bearing false-witness.

### Verse 6

We are without excuse if we do not love God with all our hearts. His gifts to us are past number, and all the gifts of men to us are fruits of his bounty.

### Verse 7

Christ was left by all his disciples; but the Father was with him. It encourages our faith that he had so large an experience of the sorrows of poverty.

### Verse 8

Those only love their souls aright that get true wisdom.

### Verse 9

Lying is a damning, destroying sin.

### Verse 10

A man that has not wisdom and grace, has no right or title to true joy. It is very unseemly for one who is a servant to sin, to oppress God's free-men.

### Verse 11

He attains the most true glory who endeavours most steadily to overcome evil with good.

### Verse 12

Christ is a King, whose wrath against his enemies will be as the roaring of a lion, and his favour to his people as the refreshing dew.

### Verse 13

It shows the vanity of the world, that we are liable to the greatest griefs where we promise ourselves the greatest comfort.

### Verse 14

A discreet and virtuous wife is more valuable than house and riches.

### Verse 15

A sluggish, slothful disposition makes men poor; it brings them to want. And this applies both to the present life and that which is to come.

### Verse 16

If we keep God's word, God's word will keep us from every thing really hurtful. We abuse the doctrine of free grace, if we think that it does away the necessity and advantage of obedience. Those that live at random must die. This truth is clearly taught in words enough to alarm the stoutest sinner.

### Verse 17

God has chosen the poor of this world, to be rich in faith, and heirs of his kingdom.

### Verse 18

When parents keep under foolish tenderness, they do their best to render children a comfort to them, and happy in themselves.

### Verse 19

The spared and spoiled child is likely to become a man of great wrath.

### Verse 20

Those that would be wise in their latter end, must be taught and ruled when young.

### Verse 21

What should we desire, but that all our purposes may agree with God's holy will?

### Verse 22

It is far better to have a heart to do good, and want ability for it, than to have ability for it, and want a heart to it.

### Verse 23

Those that live in the fear of God, shall get safety, satisfaction, and true and complete happiness.

### Verse 24

Indolence, when indulged, so grows upon people, that they have no heart to do the most needful things for themselves.

### Verse 25

A gentle rebuke goes farthest with a man of understanding.

### Verse 26

The young man who wastes his father's substance, or makes his aged mother destitute, is hateful, and will come to disgrace.

### Verse 27

It is the wisdom of young men to dread hearing such talk as puts loose and evil principles into the mind.

### Verse 28

Those are the worst of sinners, who are glad of an opportunity to sin.

### Verse 29

The unbelief of man shall not make God's threatenings of no effect. Christ himself, when bearing sins not his own, was not spared. Justice and judgment took hold of our blessed Surety; and will God spare obstinate sinners?
