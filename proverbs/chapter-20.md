## Chapter 20


### Verse 1

It seems hard to believe that men of the greatest abilities, as well as the ignorant, should render themselves fools and madmen, merely for the taste or excitement produced by strong liquors.

### Verse 2

How formidable kings are to those who provoke them! how much more foolish then is it to provoke the King of kings!

### Verse 3

To engage in quarrels is the greatest folly that can be. Yield, and even give up just demands, for peaceâ€™ sake.

### Verse 4

He who labours and endures hardship in his seed-time for eternity, will be properly diligent as to his earthly business.

### Verse 5

Though many capable of giving wise counsel are silent, yet something may be drawn from them, which will reward those who obtain it.

### Verse 6

It is hard to find those that have done, and will do more good than they speak, or care to hear spoken of.

### Verse 7

A good man is not liable to uneasiness in contriving what he shall do, or in reflecting on what he has done, as those who walk in deceit. And his family fare better for his sake.

### Verse 8

If great men are good men, they may do much good, and prevent very much evil.

### Verse 9

Some can say, Through grace, we are cleaner than we have been; but it was the work of the Holy Spirit.

All our powers and faculties are from God, and are to be employed for him.

### Verse 13

Those that indulge themselves, may expect to want necessaries, which should have been gotten by honest labour.

### Verse 14

Men use arts to get a good bargain, and to buy cheap; whereas a man ought to be ashamed of a fraud and a lie.

### Verse 15

He that prefers true knowledge to riches, follows the ways of religion and happiness. If we really believed this truth, the word of God would be valued as it deserves, and the world would lose its tempting influence.

### Verse 16

Those ruin themselves who entangle themselves in rash suretiship. Also those who are in league with abandoned women. Place no confidence in either.

### Verse 17

Wealth gotten by fraud may be sweet, for the carnal mind takes pleasure in the success of wicked devices; but it will be bitter in the reflection.

### Verse 18

Especially we need advice in spiritual warfare. The word and Spirit of God are the best counsellors in every point.

### Verse 19

Those dearly buy their own praise, who put confidence in a man because he speaks fairly.

### Verse 20

An undutiful child will become very miserable. Never let him expect any peace or comfort.

### Verse 23

A bargain made by fraud will prove a losing bargain in the end.

### Verse 24

How can we form plans, and conduct business, independently of the Lord?

### Verse 25

The evasions men often use with their own consciences show how false and deceitful man is.

### Verse 26

Justice should crush the wicked, and separate them from the virtuous.

### Verse 27

The rational soul and conscience are as a lamp within us, which should be used in examining our dispositions and motives with the revealed will of God.

### Verse 28

Mercy and truth are the glories of God's throne.

### Verse 29

Both young and old have their advantages; and let neither despise or envy the other.

### Verse 30

Severe rebukes sometimes do a great deal of good. But such is the corruption of nature, that men are loth to be rebuked for their sins. If God uses severe afflictions, to purify our hearts and fit us for his service, we have cause to be very thankful.
