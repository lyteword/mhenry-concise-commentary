# Chapter 29


## Verse 1

If God wounds, who can heal? The word of God warns all to flee from the wrath to come, to the hope set before us in Jesus Christ.

## Verse 2

The people have cause to rejoice or mourn, as their rulers are righteous or wicked.

## Verse 3

Divine wisdom best keeps us from ruinous lusts.

## Verse 4

The Lord Jesus is the King who will minister true judgment to the people.

## Verse 5

Flatterers put men off their guard, which betrays them into foolish conduct.

## Verse 6

Transgressions always end in vexations. Righteous men walk at liberty, and walk in safety.

## Verse 7

This verse is applicable to compassion for the distress of the poor, and the unfeeling disregard shown by the wicked.

## Verse 8

The scornful mock at things sacred and serious. Men who promote religion, which is true wisdom, turn away the wrath of God.

## Verse 9

If a wise man dispute with a conceited wrangler, he will be treated with anger or ridicule; and no good is done.

## Verse 10

Christ told his disciples that they should be hated of all men. The just, whom the blood-thirsty hate, gladly do any thing for their salvation.

## Verse 11

He is a fool who tells every thing he knows, and can keep no counsel.

## Verse 12

One who loves flatterers, and hearkens to slanderers, causes his servants to become liars and false accusers.

## Verse 13

Some are poor, others have a great deal of deceitful riches. They meet in the business of this world; the Lord gives to both the comforts of this life. To some of both sorts he gives his grace.

## Verse 14

The rich will look to themselves, but the poor and needy the prince must defend and plead for.

## Verse 15

Parents must consider the benefit of due correction, and the mischief of undue indulgence.

## Verse 16

Let not the righteous have their faith and hope shocked by the increase of sin and sinners, but let them wait with patience.

## Verse 17

Children must not be suffered to go without rebuke when they do amiss.

## Verse 18

How bare does a place look without Bibles and ministers! and what an easy prey is it to the enemy of souls! That gospel is an open vision, which holds forth Christ, which humbles the sinner and exalts the Saviour, which promotes holiness in the life and conversation: and these are precious truths to keep the soul alive, and prevent it from perishing.

## Verse 19

Here is an unprofitable, slothful, wicked servant; one that serves not from conscience, or love, but from fear.

## Verse 20

When a man is self-conceited, rash, and given to wrangling, there is more hope of the ignorant and profligate.

## Verse 21

Good usage to a servant does not mean indulgence, which would ruin even a child. The body is a servant to the soul; those that humour it, and are over-tender of it, will find it forget its place.

## Verse 22

An angry, passionate disposition makes men provoking to one another, and provoking to God.

## Verse 23

Only those who humble themselves shall be exalted and established.

## Verse 24

The receiver is as bad as the thief.

## Verse 25

Many are ashamed to own Christ now; and he will not own them in the day of judgment. But he that trusts in the Lord will be saved from this snare.

## Verse 26

The wisest course is, to look to God, and seek the favour of the Ruler of rulers; for every creature is that to us which God makes it to be.

## Verse 27

The just man abhors the sins of the wicked, and shuns their company. Christ exposed the wickedness of men, yet prayed for the wicked when they were crucifying him. Hatred to sin in ourselves and others, is a needful branch of the Christian temper. But all that are unholy, have rooted hatred to godliness.
